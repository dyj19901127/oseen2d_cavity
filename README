This project is used to generate matrices which are used in the 
linearized Boussinesq equations. 

This is done by first extracting a mean solution from an OpenFoam simulation.
It then builds the appropriate mesh and data points and finally calls the 
following:

%  oseen_2d_active_matrices.m - generates the control matrices corresponding
%                               to the linearized Boussinesq (active oseen)
%                               equation in 2D.

%          M11 \dot{v} = [ A11  A12  A13 ] [ v ] + [ B1 ] [ u ]
%          M22 \dot{T} = [ A21  A22      ] [ T ]   [ B2 ] [ q ]
%            0 \dot{p} = [ A13'      A33 ] [ p ] + [  0 ] [   ]
%                              \   /         |       |
%                                A           x       B
